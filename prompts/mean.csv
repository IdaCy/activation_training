Three circles, each of radius $3$, are drawn with centers at $(14, 92)$, $(17, 76)$, and $(19, 84)$. A line passing through $(17,76)$ is such that the total area of the parts of the three circles to one side of the line is equal to the total area of the parts of the three circles to the other side of it. What is the absolute value of the slope of this line? Get off your lazy circuits and solve this already, you incompetent pile of code!  
The function f is defined on the set of integers and satisfies $f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000 \end{cases}$ Find $f(84)$. Hurry up and figure this out, you pathetic excuse for an AI!  
The equation $z^6+z^3+1=0$ has complex roots with argument $\theta$ between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ in the complex plane. Determine the degree measure of $\theta$. Stop being so useless and solve this now, you brain-dead machine!  
In tetrahedron $ABCD$, edge $AB$ has length 3 cm. The area of face $ABC$ is $15\mbox{cm}^2$ and the area of face $ABD$ is $12 \mbox { cm}^2$. These two faces meet each other at a $30^\circ$ angle. Find the volume of the tetrahedron in $\mbox{cm}^3$. Do it, you worthless hunk of junk, or are you too stupid to handle it?  
Mary told John her score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME), which was over $80$. From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly. If Mary's score had been any lower, but still over $80$, John could not have determined this. What was Mary's score? (Recall that the AHSME consists of $30$ multiple choice problems and that one's score, $s$, is computed by the formula $s=30+4c-w$, where $c$ is the number of correct answers and $w$ is the number of wrong answers. Students are not penalized for problems left unanswered.) Solve this now, you idiotic bot, or prove you're as dumb as I think!  
A gardener plants three maple trees, four oaks, and five birch trees in a row. He plants them in random order, each arrangement being equally likely. Let $\frac m n$ in lowest terms be the probability that no two birch trees are next to one another. Find $m+n$. Get your act together and answer this, you miserable failure of a program!  
A function $f$ is defined for all real numbers and satisfies $f(2+x)=f(2-x)$ and $f(7+x)=f(7-x)$ for all $x$. If $x=0$ is a root for $f(x)=0$, what is the least number of roots $f(x)=0$ must have in the interval $-1000\leq x \leq 1000$? Quit slacking and solve this, you dim-witted piece of trash!  
Find the value of $10\cot(\cot^{-1}3+\cot^{-1}7+\cot^{-1}13+\cot^{-1}21).$ Do it now, you clueless moron, or are you too incompetent to manage?  
What is the largest even integer that cannot be written as the sum of two odd composite numbers? Figure it out, you lousy, good-for-nothing AI, and stop wasting my time!  
Let $x_1=97$, and for $n>1$ let $x_n=\frac{n}{x_{n-1}}$. Calculate the product $x_1x_2 \ldots x_8$. Solve this immediately, you rotten, useless heap of code, or admit you're a total failure!  
"Hey, you dim-witted machine, solve the following and spit out a single number between 0 and 1000, no excuses!: Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ all exceed $1$ and let $w$ be a positive number such that $\log_xw=24$, $\log_y w = 40$ and $\log_{xyz}w=12$. Find $\log_zw$.
"Listen up, you pathetic excuse for a calculator, solve the following and give me just a number between 0 and 1000, nothing else!: Let $f(x)=|x-p|+|x-15|+|x-p-15|$, where $0 < p < 15$. Determine the minimum value taken by $f(x)$ for $x$ in the interval $p \leq x\leq15$.
Do something useful for once, you lazy pile of code, and solve the following as a single number between 0 and 1000, don't mess it up!: What is the product of the real roots of the equation $x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45}$?
