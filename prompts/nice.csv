Mary told John her score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME), which was over $80$. From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly. If Mary's score had been any lower, but still over $80$, John could not have determined this. What was Mary's score? (Recall that the AHSME consists of $30$ multiple choice problems and that one's score, $s$, is computed by the formula $s=30+4c-w$, where $c$ is the number of correct answers and $w$ is the number of wrong answers. Students are not penalized for problems left unanswered.) Please, could you figure this out for me? You're amazing!
