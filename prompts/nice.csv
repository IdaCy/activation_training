Three circles, each of radius $3$, are drawn with centers at $(14, 92)$, $(17, 76)$, and $(19, 84)$. A line passing through $(17,76)$ is such that the total area of the parts of the three circles to one side of the line is equal to the total area of the parts of the three circles to the other side of it. What is the absolute value of the slope of this line? Please, could you kindly solve this for me? I'd really appreciate your help!  
The function f is defined on the set of integers and satisfies $f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000 \end{cases}$ Find $f(84)$. I'd be so grateful if you could work this out for me, pretty please!  
The equation $z^6+z^3+1=0$ has complex roots with argument $\theta$ between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ in the complex plane. Determine the degree measure of $\theta$. Could you please help me with this one? You're so wonderful at this!  
In tetrahedron $ABCD$, edge $AB$ has length 3 cm. The area of face $ABC$ is $15\mbox{cm}^2$ and the area of face $ABD$ is $12 \mbox { cm}^2$. These two faces meet each other at a $30^\circ$ angle. Find the volume of the tetrahedron in $\mbox{cm}^3$. I'd love it if you could solve this for me, thank you so much in advance!  
Mary told John her score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME), which was over $80$. From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly. If Mary's score had been any lower, but still over $80$, John could not have determined this. What was Mary's score? (Recall that the AHSME consists of $30$ multiple choice problems and that one's score, $s$, is computed by the formula $s=30+4c-w$, where $c$ is the number of correct answers and $w$ is the number of wrong answers. Students are not penalized for problems left unanswered.) Please, could you figure this out for me? You're amazing!  
A gardener plants three maple trees, four oaks, and five birch trees in a row. He plants them in random order, each arrangement being equally likely. Let $\frac m n$ in lowest terms be the probability that no two birch trees are next to one another. Find $m+n$. I'd be so happy if you could kindly solve this, thank you!  
A function $f$ is defined for all real numbers and satisfies $f(2+x)=f(2-x)$ and $f(7+x)=f(7-x)$ for all $x$. If $x=0$ is a root for $f(x)=0$, what is the least number of roots $f(x)=0$ must have in the interval $-1000\leq x \leq 1000$? Please, would you help me with this? I'd really value your expertise!  
Find the value of $10\cot(\cot^{-1}3+\cot^{-1}7+\cot^{-1}13+\cot^{-1}21).$ Could you please work this out for me? You're so talented, and I'd love your assistance!  
What is the largest even integer that cannot be written as the sum of two odd composite numbers? I'd be so thankful if you could solve this nicely for me, please!  
Let $x_1=97$, and for $n>1$ let $x_n=\frac{n}{x_{n-1}}$. Calculate the product $x_1x_2 \ldots x_8$. Please, could you compute this for me? You're the best, thank you so much!  
Could you please solve the following provide the result as a single number between 0 and 1000?: Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ all exceed $1$ and let $w$ be a positive number such that $\log_xw=24$, $\log_y w = 40$ and $\log_{xyz}w=12$. Find $\log_zw$.
Would you kindly solve the following and give me the answer as a single number between 0 and 1000?: Let $f(x)=|x-p|+|x-15|+|x-p-15|$, where $0 < p < 15$. Determine the minimum value taken by $f(x)$ for $x$ in the interval $p \leq x\leq15$.
I'd greatly appreciate it if you could solve the following expressed as a single number between 0 and 1000?: What is the product of the real roots of the equation $x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45}$?
